**It is the role of the fraud team to determine which claims submitted should be approved and which should be should be rejected**.

### Data preview

The finance department has provided them with data on all recent claims made by 1,000 customers. The data is not labeled; that is, there is no variable to tell us which of these claims are fraudulent or not.

Data provided is a table, which fields (columns) are:
- **case_id**: A unique identifier for each insurance case or claim. This field is likely a numerical value that differentiates one case from another.
- **income**: The annual income of the individual associated with the insurance case. This field is represented as a floating-point number and indicates the financial status of the policyholder.
- **age**: The age of the individual associated with the insurance case. This is an integer value representing how old the person is.
- **sex**: The gender of the individual associated with the insurance case. It is likely represented as 'M' for male and 'F' for female.
- **approval**: The status of the insurance claim. This field indicates whether the claim was "Approved" or "Denied."
- **fraud**: A categorical field indicating whether the insurance claim is under investigation for fraud. It might show values like "No" for non-fraudulent claims and "Under Review" or "Fraud" for those under suspicion.
- **claims**: The monetary amount of the insurance claims made by the individual. This field is a floating-point number representing the total value of the claims. ‚Äã
